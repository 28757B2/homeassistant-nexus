"""
#### Packet Information (from https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/blob/master/src/devices/nexus.c) ###

    Nexus sensor protocol with ID, temperature and optional humidity
    also FreeTec (Pearl) NC-7345 sensors for FreeTec Weatherstation NC-7344,
    also infactory/FreeTec (Pearl) NX-3980 sensors for infactory/FreeTec NX-3974 station,
    also Solight TE82S sensors for Solight TE76/TE82/TE83/TE84 stations,
    also TFA 30.3209.02 temperature/humidity sensor.
    The sensor sends 36 bits 12 times,
    the packets are ppm modulated (distance coding) with a pulse of ~500 us
    followed by a short gap of ~1000 us for a 0 bit or a long ~2000 us gap for a
    1 bit, the sync gap is ~4000 us.
    The data is grouped in 9 nibbles:
        [id0] [id1] [flags] [temp0] [temp1] [temp2] [const] [humi0] [humi1]
    - The 8-bit id changes when the battery is changed in the sensor.
    - flags are 4 bits B 0 C C, where B is the battery status: 1=OK, 0=LOW
    - and CC is the channel: 0=CH1, 1=CH2, 2=CH3
    - temp is 12 bit signed scaled by 10
    - const is always 1111 (0x0F)
    - humidity is 8 bits
